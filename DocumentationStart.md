# Java Game Networking (JGN) Documentation #

## Introduction to jME Networking ##

There exist several viable ways to document a project like JGN.  The approach I've taken here involves beginning with a detailed explanation of the multiplayer jME FlagRushTutorial, a simple 3D game which you can find in the [jme-networking package](#Downloads.md).  Using the FlagRushTutorial as a starting point, I proceed to describe the components of JGN which make the tutorial work, such as the [JGNServer](JGNServer.md), the [JGNClient](JGNClient.md), the SyncWrapper object, the SynchronizationManager, and the [JMEGraphicalController](JMEGraphicalController.md).

Using the FlagRushTutorial as an entry point into the inner workings of JGN provides certain advantages, especially for people interested in using JGN to facilitate the networking component of a jME-powered game.  However, people uninterested in or unfamiliar with jME may wish to ignore the pages of this wiki that pertain to the FlagRushTutorial and skip to some of the more abstract topics listed above.  After all, while JGN works well with jME-related projects, you can use it for a variety of other, non-jME projects too.  People interested in contributing to documentation regarding the features and uses of JGN that don't relate to jME should edit this page and post links to such information below.
